# pokelidokeli

## Basic idea
- find pokemon by browings or searching by type. Add them to your favourites cookie and e-mail a friend with a pokemonster to check out
- Becode PHP exercise

## implementation
### principles
- paid more attention to code quality: type hinting, security on classes, re-usability, yoda rule, limit indentation, strict type, defensive programming, names, comments, file structure, refactoring, as little PHP in html(view) as possible
- separate json logic from pokemon classes in order to have reusable code in case the API changes in structure, MVC
### how it works
- database class fills up pokemonS class and while constructing it calls the pokemon (singular) class that also contains another api call to get more details (image and so)
- controller checks URL paramters and sets dummy paramters if not used. If/else checks structure triggers relevant database calls. (In previous version - see "old-version" branch, SESSION was used for this)
- also have universal getters function that returns any property of class instance that is called. There are not any properties that need to be hidden atm
- displaying of actual pokemon is done by populating functions that in turn contains components such as pagination that re-use or append these paramters
- concated array of previous pokemons searched with new pokemons in order to be able to search it to display it when for instance you are browsing page 2 but still want to be able to see a favourited pokemon on page 1 using search_in ... -method
### other stuff
- didn't really follow the overview, categorie ... structure of the assignment as I did not really get what was asked for
- onyl one e-mailfield but multiple favourited pokemon to send over, including a link to detail page
- javascript disabling of certain options when not relevant
- validation of mailing functionaltiy
- started phan testing: see analysis.txt file (still need to check stuff)
- basic bootstrap styling
- Heroku deployment

## To do's
### style
- style block of favourites. Something with row and width, check margins and such because the borders are overlapping. Maybe different box-model?
- also: if too many favourites, the left column leaves a lot of whitespace that is not present when few pokes are favourited
### features
- overview page's base logic is solid, but I don't know what info to display there. Not first priority anyway
- check if mailer works from BeCode's location and elsewhere. mail-tester.com error report included here
- created half working function (yet good concept) that easily searches json for property and sets this as property of pokemon instance. Functional for images, names ... not much more
- need to variably display pagenumbers. This will work for standard browsing, but can't be provided beforehand for type searches as these are so variable. Maybe disable for first search, but after re-render, this is known and can be adapted? 
- button to remove from favourites
### need for speed
- speed is shit with this concating of earlier searched pokemon. Is it really that? In performance thingie of mozilla dev tools it's a few seconds just for the images (which are individual api-calls). Most of it, is 'HTML though'. Not clear whether this is because of my slow local device or wether the api-calls are in there (the concating of old and new, as I say it). Actually, this could be, as SESSION - I believe - is stored on the server and not on the local device. Trial and error up next?
- NOPE alternative 3: I could try to serve this code on a faster device. How's Heroku? About the same... so not it
- NOPE alternative 4: use cookies instead of sessions. How's that? About the same...
- PROBABLY YES alternatively, alternative 2: throw away this way of thinking and just call the api with the id's of the favourited pokemon directly instead of storing previous things in SESSION
- NOPE alternative 1:  I could use react front-end with state and such and only call API if new things are needed. Not sure if this way of thinking is actually correct; I am already storing a lot in session; I DON'T call page 1 + 2 + 3 ... I store page 1 and 2 when showing 3. This alternative is costly, as it is a lot of work


### others
- feedback Danny: my way of including html in function is creating new view. Better to have a few lines of PHP in MY view than to create this awkward function. Thijs: you will need to mix php and html at some point anyway. Figure out these concepts and get file structure up to standard

# ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT BELOW

# Title: The Extreme pokemon challenge
- Repository: `challenge-pokemon-php` (You should already have this repo, just make a branch on it.)
- Type of Challenge: `Learning Challenge`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Deployment strategy : `Heroku`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Javascript or PHP?
This challenge can be done in PHP or Javascript.

## Learning Objectives
- To be able to solve frontend problems in PHP
- To be able to process a form in PHP

## Mission
We are going to use the PHP implementation of the Pokemon challenge you made before, but we are going to expand on it in various steps:

- Make a "category" page where you show 20 pokemon at the time in a grid. Display their picture and name, a make it clickable to go to their overview page.
- At the top and bottom of that "category" page, add a [pagination component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/pagination/).
- At the top of the page, create a dropdown with all the types (fire, water, ...). When the user selects one, the interface only shows pokemon of that specific type.
- Add a dropdown that changes the amount of pokemon you can see on the category page.
- Make it possible to "favorite" a Pokemon. When you "favor" a pokemon, it shows up at the top of the category page in a separate section labeled "Favorite pokemon". (You can save this in a Cookie.)
- Once a pokemon is favored, add the possibility to mail a friend the url of a favored pokemon with the text "Look at this pokemon, it is so cool!"

## Javascript or PHP?
This challenge can be done in PHP or Javascript.

## Learning Objectives
- To be able to solve frontend problems in PHP
- To be able to process a form in PHP

## Mission
We are going to use the PHP implementation of the Pokemon challenge you made before, but we are going to expand on it in various steps:

- Make a "category" page where you show 20 pokemon at the time in a grid. Display their picture and name, a make it clickable to go to their overview page.
- At the top and bottom of that "category" page, add a [pagination component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/pagination/).
- At the top of the page, create a dropdown with all the types (fire, water, ...). When the user selects one, the interface only shows pokemon of that specific type.
- Add a dropdown that changes the amount of pokemon you can see on the category page.
- Make it possible to "favorite" a Pokemon. When you "favor" a pokemon, it shows up at the top of the category page in a separate section labeled "Favorite pokemon". (You can save this in a Cookie.)
- Once a pokemon is favored, add the possibility to mail a friend the url of a favored pokemon with the text "Look at this pokemon, it is so cool!"
